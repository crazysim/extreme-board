# Zurb Foundation Blog

This project (will) serve as an example of how to use Zurb Foundation and
Nanoc.

One aspect not seen in any other nanoc project is the lack of vendoring of the
Foundation gem's Javascript into the project. This should make updating this
dependency much easier.

# Current Status

* Good enough for a brochure site.
* Blogging not ready yet.
